# Siena Scalp EEG Database (PhysioNet siena-scalp-eeg 1.0.0), EEG-BIDS

Scalp video-EEG of 14 adults with epilepsy (9 male, 5 female; aged 20–71), recorded at the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of
the University of Siena, Italy, with 47 annotated seizures in about 128 hours of recording. Sampling rate 512 Hz; electrodes on the
international 10-20 system (most patients also have 10-10 positions); most recordings include 1 or 2 EKG channels. This is a BIDS
curation of the PhysioNet release (Detti 2020, doi:10.13026/5d4a-j060), described in Detti, Vatti & Zabalo Manrique de Lara 2020,
Processes 8(7):846.

## Source description (PhysioNet, verbatim excerpts)
- "The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of
  Siena. Subjects include 9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58)." (The paper gives 36–71 for the males; subject_info.csv,
  used for `participants.tsv`, has male ages 25–71.)
- "The data were acquired employing EB Neuro and Natus Quantum LTM amplifiers, and reusable silver/gold cup electrodes. Patients were
  asked to stay in the bed as much as possible, either asleep or awake."
- "The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures according to the criteria of the International League Against
  Epilepsy were performed by an expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and electrophysiological data of each patient."
- "The data has been collected ... during a regional research project, called PANACEE, aiming at the development of noninvasive
  patient-specific monitoring/control low-cost devices for the prediction of epileptic seizures."

## Ethics (verbatim, PhysioNet page and paper)
The Ethical Committee of the University of Siena approved the data in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. At the time of admission at the clinics, each patient signed a written informed consent in which agrees to the video registration and to the use of the data for a possible scientific divulgation.

## Contents
- `sub-PNxx/eeg/sub-PNxx_task-szMonitoring_run-NN_eeg.edf`: the 41 original EDF files, **byte-identical** to the release
  (no re-reference, filter, resampling or re-write). `sub-PNxx_scans.tsv` maps every run to its original file name (e.g. `PN10-4.5.6.edf`).
- `*_channels.tsv`: channel names exactly as in the EDF. The release's `Seizures-list-PNxx.txt` lists the channels that carry the EEG
  and EKG signals and says "all other channels in the edf files must be ignored". Its channel numbers do not match the EDF channel
  order in several files (e.g. PN01, PN03), so channels were matched **by name**: EDF `EEG X` = listed `X` (the listed "1" is a
  truncated "O1"), and the listed "EKG 1"/"EKG 2" = the EDF channels labelled `1`/`2`. Listed channels are `status=good`; all other
  channels (e.g. `EKG EKG`, `SPO2`, `HR`, `PLET`, `MK`, unlabelled numbers/letters, and EEG positions the list leaves out) are
  `status=bad` with that reason. `release_label` gives the listed name. Types: EEG, ECG, MISC. Units from the EDF header.
- `*_events.tsv`: one row per seizure (`trial_type=seizure`), 47 in total. `onset` = seizure clock time in the release minus the
  EDF header start time (modulo 24 h); `release_start_time` / `release_end_time` keep the release strings verbatim.
- `participants.tsv`: age, sex, ILAE seizure type (IAS focal onset impaired awareness; WIAS focal onset without impaired awareness;
  FBTC focal to bilateral tonic-clonic), localisation, lateralisation, channel and seizure counts and recording minutes, from
  `subject_info.csv`.
- `sourcedata/physionet-siena-scalp-eeg-1.0.0/`: the complete original release (EDF files, Seizures-list text files,
  `subject_info.csv`, `RECORDS`, `LICENSE.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`), verified against PhysioNet's SHA256SUMS.

## Dates and privacy
The release states that "all dates in the .edf files are de-identified": every EDF header reads 01.01.yy, and the patient and recording
identification fields are blank. They are kept as released. Times of day are real clock times and are kept because the seizure
annotations are given as clock times.

## Release inconsistencies (kept visible, not silently corrected)
- `PN00/PN00-3.edf` seizure 3: seizure end (19.29.29) lies after the end of the recording (registration end 18.57.13); duration set to n/a (release value not corrected). The SzCORE annotation in `derivatives/szcore` reads it as 18.29.29 (60 s).
- `PN01/PN01-1.edf` seizure 1: no file name in release text; subject has one file.
- `PN01/PN01-1.edf` seizure 2: no file name in release text; subject has one file.
- `PN05/PN05-3.edf` seizure 3: release registration start 06.01.23 differs from EDF header start 06.01.13.
- `PN06/PN06-1.edf` seizure 1: file name typo in release: 'PNO6-1.edf' -> PN06-1.edf.
- `PN06/PN06-2.edf` seizure 2: file name typo in release: 'PNO6-2.edf' -> PN06-2.edf.
- `PN06/PN06-4.edf` seizure 4: file name typo in release: 'PNO6-4.edf' -> PN06-4.edf.
- `PN10/PN10-2.edf` seizure 2: release gives two end times ("11.41.04 opure 11.40.43"; Italian "oppure" = "or"); the first is used.
- `PN10/PN10-3.edf` seizure 3: release gives clinical and electrical onset ("15.43.53 (CLINICAL ONSET); 15.43.59 (ELECTRIC ONSET)"); the first (clinical) is used.
- `PN10/PN10-4.5.6.edf` seizure 6: release gives clinical and electrical onset ("15.18.26 (CLINICAL ONSET)"); the first (clinical) is used.
- `PN11/PN11-1.edf` seizure 1: file name typo in release: 'PN11-.edf' -> PN11-1.edf (only file).
- `PN14/PN14-3.edf` seizure 3: release registration start 16.17.45 differs from EDF header start 19.17.45; the EDF header start is correct (19.17.45 + 41995 s = 06.57.40, the release registration end).
- PN10: `subject_info.csv` gives 20 EEG channels, but `Seizures-list-PN10.txt` lists 19 EEG positions (Fp1, F3, C3, P3, O1, F7, T3, T5, Fz, Cz, Pz, Fp2, F4, C4, P4, O2, F8, T4, T6); those 19 are `status=good` and the other EEG channels in the PN10 EDFs are `status=bad` as the release instructs.
- The channel numbers in the Seizures-list files do not match the EDF channel order in many files (45 listed channels across the release); channels were matched by name (see Contents).

## SzCORE annotations (derivatives/szcore)
`derivatives/szcore/` holds the seizure annotations of the BIDS Siena Scalp EEG Database v1.0.0 released for the SzCORE
seizure-detection benchmark by Jonathan Dan and Paolo Detti (Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.10640762; Dan et al. 2024, Epilepsia,
doi:10.1111/epi.18113), copied byte-for-byte and renamed to this dataset's subject and run labels. They add a standardised
seizure type per event (`sz_foc_ia`, `sz_foc_a`, `sz_foc_f2b`, with HED tags). Of 47 seizures, 41 agree with the raw
`events.tsv` within 0.5 s. The release-text ambiguities behind the other 6 are listed in `derivatives/szcore/README.md`. One is
an error in the SzCORE release: PN14 run-03 is 3 h late there (17540 s instead of 6740 s). For PN00 run-03 the raw duration stays n/a (the release end time
is after the end of the recording); SzCORE gives 60 s.
